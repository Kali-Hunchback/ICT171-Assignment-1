    <title>TCO & Proposal | Wade Roberts (#32666275)</title>

        <h1 class="heading">Website Proposal</h1>
        <h2 id="subheading">Wade Roberts: #32666275</h2>
        <p class="text-container">The project to be undertaken is a personal portfolio site for the sake of future employment and 
            consolidation a series of projects which I undertake on an educational, self-improvement, 
            and personal basis additional to projects I will start in the future. </p>
        <p class="text-container">Initially, the website is proposed to be built in a few various pages. These represent typical undertakings for portfolio sites.</p>
        <p class="text-container">The site should include <br></p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li class="list-items">A landing page, which displays a “headline statement”. </li>
            <li class="list-items">The landing page should contain some form of navigation element which should be represented on linking pages, as necessary.</li>
            <li class="list-items">An about me page, in which I provide some information about what I am currently undertaking regarding projects and my interests.</li>
            <li class="list-items">A contact page, hopefully, this can be set up to enable an email to be forwarded on to my work associated email from within the webpage <br>
                (most likely to be undertaken as a form and handled by PHP, more research is to be completed). Within this page there will also be links for work related socials (LinkedIn, TryHackMe, GitHub to begin with). <br> 
                Where there is information available from the other services to display inside of the page (Such as TryHackMe having a profile graphic which can be embedded using HTML and JavaScript) 
                this shall be used instead of the conventional linking methods.</li>
            <li class="list-items">A blog page, which serves as a container for integrating my previous (and future) Medium posts which primarily contain TryHackMe Room write-ups. </li>
            <li class="list-items">The website should be responsive and available on a series of screen dimensions. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-container">This outlines the minimum I would like to implement. There is a possible expansion of services and consideration has begun on whether other elements such as an RDBMS will be necessary to facilitate what is planned but this will be decided throughout the life cycle of the project.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">License Rationale</h1>
        <p class="text-container">I have chosen to invoke copyright for this project. This decision has been due to the ability to do given terms expressed in the Apache 2.0 Software License (for apache2) and GNUv2 License (for Linux). <br>
            Additionally, as the website will be serving as a personal portfolio, I would like the property to remain mine. As the content will be my own creation and refer to my own education and professional presentation there should be no distribution of the materials which I produce. <br>
            I believe this is an appropriate form of licensing for the project.</p>
